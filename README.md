Model selection, training and tuning completed.
In the end, I settled on a simple ANN model taken from here:
(https://www.kaggle.com/sachinsarkar/urban-sound-classification-usnig-librosa-and-ann)

The training was done on recorded .wav with guitar sounds. (216 samples). Final accuracy in the graph below

## TODO
* ~~Now we are working on finding the best way to connect the work of the model with the module that reads the sound from the microphone~~ (Closed in 16/05/2022)
* At the moment, the main task is to finalize the graphic module
